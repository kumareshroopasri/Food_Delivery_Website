# Food_Delivery_Website
The Online Food Delivery Website is a full-stack Java web application that allows users to browse menus, add food items to a cart, place orders, and view order details.
It follows an MVC-style architecture using Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, with clean data handling via DAO and Model layers.
